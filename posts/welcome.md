I have enjoyed developing websites over the past year but realised that my site had gotten a little dated in comparison to my skills, so I built this new one! Using Preact, Next.JS and Markdown. I am interested in seeing how it will fair in comparison to my previous site, the code is certainly much cleaner so I am looking forward to working with it.

## New Blog

Alongside this website I shall be relaunching my blog, previously my blog was written on Medium and very briefly on Dev.to, I still think these are great platforms but the challenge of setting up a blog myself as well as the ability to have total control of the content interests me a lot and so therefore I have chosen to write it in Markdown directly in my code editor of choice, vim.

## Questions

If you have any questions on the new site or anything else feel free to reach out to me on social media or through the contact form on my website!

Thanks for reading,

Mac
