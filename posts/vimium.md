Now I know what you're thinking...

Mac there is no way a browser extension can be that good, however that my friends is where you would be wrong. The secret behind this extension is the pure simplicity of it, alongside this you are greeted with an extension that will easily help you increase your speed while whizzing around the various pages on the internet.

I am talking of course about Vimium (Vimari if you use Safari), this extension is availible for all modern browsers. I can hear you asking the question 'I don't even use Vim why would I want a browser extension for it' and I say to that, because you can browse the web without your hands ever leaving your keyboard.

All you have to do is open up your browsers extension store, plonk Vimium or Vimari into your search bar, install and away you go.

## How does it work?

Simple, head on over to Google, Duck Duck Go, Qwant (or another preferred search engine or website) then search for whatever you like, once the page loads, alternate between pressing J and K and you will find the browser scrolling up and down the page for you, amazing no need for that pesky scroll wheel anymore. Next up try pressing F you will be shocked to see a large amount of letter combinations appear on the screen, try typing one of them A for example, whatever the link below the A label is, you will find your browser navigating to it, you can extend this by adding a shift before typing the label and it will open in a new tab.

You can navigate forwards and backwards in history with Shift + h and Shift + L as well as many more shortcuts (read through the documentation to learn more.)

I hope you are as amazed by this wonderful little addition to a browser as I am!
